# while and Boolean homework

## movie_tickets.py
 A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a person’s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket.

## pizza_toppings.py
Write a loop that prompts the user to enter a series of pizza toppings
until they enter a `'quit'` value. As they enter each topping, print a message saying you’ll add that topping to their pizza.
- Use a conditional test in the while statement to stop the loop.
- Use a *Boolean value* to control how long the loop runs.

## infinity.py
Write a loop that never ends, and run it. (To end the loop, press `CTRL-C` or close the window displaying the output.)
