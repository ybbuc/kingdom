```
Add one line of code to print out the line below, where `[name]`
 represents the inputted name.
 ```
[name] says, "Hail to the King!"

## Question 2
Write code that prompts the user with the phrase "Easy peasyâ€¦". If they reply "lemon squeezy" (not case sensitive), then ask them for for their name and the name of the King. If the user enters `Jakob`, let them know they are correct and that they can be of good service to the King. If they are wrong, tell them that the king they entered is false and prompt them to enter it again.

```
Easy peasy... no
Easy peasy... lEmOn SqUeEzY
Enter your name: George
Enter the name of the King: Barry
Barry is a false king!
Enter the name of the King: Jakob
George, you can be of good service to King Jakob.
```

## Question 5
Write code using a `for` loop that displays the following:
```
90 / 10 = 9
80 / 10 = 8
70 / 10 = 7
60 / 10 = 6
50 / 10 = 5
40 / 10 = 4
30 / 10 = 3
20 / 10 = 2
10 / 10 = 1
```

## Question 6
Create a function named `add_squares`, which accepts three arguments. The function adds the squares of the numbers together and returns the result. No `print` is allowed in the function.

Create three variables. Call the function and pass it the variables. Then display the message below, using the variables and the result return from the function
```
4 squared plus 7 squared plus 9 squared equals 146
```

## Question 7
Write code that asks the user if they have betrayed the King. If the user has betrayed the King, ask for their name. Then display a message telling them the knights are coming for them.
```
Have you betrayed the King y/n? y
Please enter your name: Mary
The knights of the King will find you, Mary.
```
Otherwise, the program should ask the user to enter the names of three people who have betrayed King Jakob (do this with a `for` loop). The program should then display a message telling them the knights are coming for those people.
```
Have you betrayed the King y/n? n
Who has betrayed the King? Todd
Who has betrayed the King? Jill
Who has betrayed the king? Thomas
The knights of the King will find Todd, Jill, and Thomas.
```

The length of the sides of the equilateral triangles is 150.

Your turtle arrow is not required to end in the same place/direction as shown below.
